# Blue Mood theme for gedit/pluma/xed

This is a port of [emacs's Blue Mood theme](https://emacsthemes.com/themes/blue-mood-theme.html) for gedit, pluma and xed.

## Notes

Keep in mind that this port doesn't correspond 100% to the original emacs theme, due to the limitations of gtksourceview in comparison to emacs's theming system.

## Installation

Copy the bluemood.xml file to the color schemes directory: `~/.local/share/gedit/styles` (if on gedit) or `~/.local/share/gtksourceview-3.0/styles` (if on xed/pluma).

## Activation

1. Open the Preferences in Gedit/pluma/xed
2. Switch to the "Font & Colors" tab
3. Select "Blue Mood" from the "Color Scheme" list
